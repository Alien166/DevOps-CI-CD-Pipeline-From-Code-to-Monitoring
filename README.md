# This project demonstrates the creation of a comprehensive DevOps pipeline, covering every stage from code integration to real-time monitoring. The pipeline incorporates tools and technologies like GitHub for version control, Jenkins for automation, Maven for build management, SonarQube for code quality analysis, Docker and DockerHub for containerization, and ArgoCD with Helm for deployment on Kubernetes clusters. Monitoring and logging are handled using Prometheus, Grafana, Filebeat, OpenSearch, and Kibana, providing robust observability and insights. This setup offers a holistic view of modern DevOps practices in action, emphasizing automation, scalability, and reliability.
